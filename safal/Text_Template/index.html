                            <p>There comes a point in a young man&rsquo;s life when he simply cannot watch any more experimental black-and-white short films from Canada. One night in August of 2000, the mysterious Montreal band Godspeed You! Black Emperor came to play at New York&rsquo;s Knitting Factory, a club that was already much too small for this band. The show was a benefit for Anthology Film Archives, the second-run movie theater and downtown institution, and the place was oversold to a possibly-dangerous degree. Bodies were jammed into that room in ways that weren&rsquo;t even close to being comfortable. This was pre-smoking ban, and there were so many cigarette fumes in the air that your eyes started stinging the second you walked in. Those of us in that room were treated to a whole crash course in Canadian experimental film &mdash; many, many crackly black-and-white things projected on a tiny screen above the stage. Those films were the opening act. We were left with no indication of how long we might have to watch these films before this band finally came onstage.</p>
                            <p>That summer, I worked the door at the Knitting Factory. The club wasn&rsquo;t doing well. Its owners had spent a whole lot of money on its annual jazz festival, which, at least as far as I could tell, had not been successful. My paychecks kept bouncing. Musicians kept calling the main phone line to ask me where their money was, and I had no idea how to answer. One day, I walked into the club past a line of protesters who were yelling and blowing whistles, and I wondered what that was all about. It turned out that someone had rented the space out to an ad agency to shoot an Amstel Lite commercial during a SAG strike, and I&rsquo;d just unwittingly crossed a picket line. I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
                            <p>That summer, only two Knitting Factory shows sold out ahead of time. One was hometown heroes Luna, who were taping their live album, and who were transcendent. The other was Godspeed, the Montreal collective who had released their debut F♯ A♯ ∞ a few years earlier and who had already built up a ravenous cult. I went to that show that night mostly because I was curious. I&rsquo;d seen the name in zines and alt-weeklies. I hadn&rsquo;t heard the music. After maybe 45 minutes of experimental Canadian short films, I went to find the venue&rsquo;s night manager to ask when this shit would start. She told me that one of their drummers hadn&rsquo;t shown up yet, or something, and she didn&rsquo;t even know if the show would happen. So I left. By all accounts, I missed something special that night.Paragraph</p>
                            <p>Two months after that night, Godspeed You! Black Emperor released the absolutely massive double album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven, and then I knew I&rsquo;d missed something special. The album, released 20 years ago today, was rapturous &mdash; four tracks, each about 20 minutes long, spread over two CDs, sold in a kind of brown paper envelope with a picture of two disembodied hands on the front. The pieces of music &mdash; songs didn&rsquo;t seem like an adequate word &mdash; started out slow and vaporous, and then the rose and built and rose and built until they were towering waves of sound. Then those tides ebbed back and gave you a chance to think, or to feel, or to catch your breath before they slowly and deliberately rose again. Other than the crackly and ominous little samples that would come in &mdash; a convenience-store loudspeaker announcement, a folk song, an old man talking about how great Coney Island used to be &mdash; the music was instrumental. The liner notes suggested how the tracks should be carved-up into movements, and I used to drive myself nuts trying to figure out which segments of which tracks I should play on my college radio show. (Absolutely nobody listened to that thing, and you couldn&rsquo;t even hear it in most of the dorms at Syracuse. I still agonized over what to play like it meant something.) But the obvious thing to do was to just let the whole 87-minute totality of album ride &mdash; to let it drag you away into another world.Paragraph</p>
